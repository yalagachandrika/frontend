        <p>Worst movie of this decede
            Even through movie hyped with horrer comedy there is not even a single funny moment in this film.
            Movie looks like a drama juniors set graphics are worst.
            Just 3 minutes trailer made full movie.</p>
        <h6>miracle</h6>

        <li>not good</li>
        <p>Let me be clear: I am a fan. I have celebrated his rise, defended him during difficult phases, and watched
            every release with hope. But true fandom is rooted in honesty, not blind loyalty. When fans excuse films
            like this, it only encourages mediocrity-something genuine admirers should never do.

        </p>
        <li>hit</li>
        <p>Prabhas is more than just a star-he is a global representative of Indian cinema. With that stature comes
            responsibility. Films like this risk eroding the reputation he has built through years of hard work. The
            frustration among fans stems not only from the film's quality but from its wasted potential. He has the
            power to lead projects that elevate Indian cinema on the world stage, yet continues to invest time in
            ventures that feel unnecessary and poorly conceived.
